# 👋 Hey, I'm Nikita

**Low-level Systems & Game Engine Developer**  
Building high-performance software from scratch in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

---

## 🎯 What I Do

I architect and implement complex systems: from custom C++ game engines with Vulkan rendering to production-grade web applications handling real-world load. I ship - published games on Steam, maintained SaaS platforms, and built dev tools that actually work.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

**Core Systems**
- **Languages:** C++ (17/20), C#, SQL, Python, GLSL/SPIR-V
- **Graphics:** Vulkan, DirectX (learning), GPU profilers, RenderDoc
- **Build:** CMake, Git, Visual Studio, Docker (for testing)

**Web & Backend**
- **Frameworks:** ASP.NET Core, Blazor
- **Databases:** MySQL (design & optimization)
- **Architecture:** REST APIs, Entity Framework, Full-stack development

**Game Development**
- **Engine:** Custom ECS-based engine (multi-threaded, data-oriented)
- **Tech:** Voxel geometry, ray casting, custom serialization, modding support
- **Platforms:** Steam publishing, Windows/Linux

## 🔥 Key Projects

### 🎮 Custom Game Engine (C++/Vulkan)
Multi-threaded Entity Component System built from scratch. No external libs except Vulkan SDK. Features: voxel-based world generation, physics simulation, hot-reloading shaders, modding API. Written for performance, not tutorials.

### 📦 Steam-Published Game
Full lifecycle: prototype → release → post-launch support. Implemented backend for leaderboards, payment processing. Handled bugs, updates, community feedback. Real players, real metrics, real pressure.

### 🌐 Project Management SaaS
Maintained and optimized legacy ASP.NET application. Redesigned database schema (reduced query time by 40%), refactored monolithic components, implemented new UI with Blazor. Production deployment, real users.

## 💼 What I'm Looking For

Remote roles where architecture matters: game engines, graphics programming, performance-critical applications, developer tools. I excel when I own complex systems end-to-end. Not interested in CRUD apps or "just make it work" culture.

## ⚡ Quick Facts

- Late-night deep work sessions (3-4 AM pushes are normal)
- Research-driven: I read specs, not just tutorials
- Self-sufficient: built entire stack solo, from engine to deployment
- VR enthusiast (currently evaluating Quest 3 vs 3S for dev)
